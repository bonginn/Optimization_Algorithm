# SARAH vs. SVRG - Optimization Algorithm Comparison
## Introduction
This project implements, analyzes and compares the performance of two optimization algorithms: SARAH(Stochastic Recursive Gradient) and SVRG(Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient). </br>
This repository includes:
- Implementation of SARAH and SVRG algorithms
- Experimental results comparing their performance.
- A Poster summarizing the results of the experiments.
- A video presentation of the project.
